    "\"\"\"Q4. What is ‘DataFrame’ in pandas and how is it different from pandas.series? Explain with an example.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure in pandas. It is similar to a spreadsheet with rows and columns. \n",
    "It is different from pandas.Series in that it can contain multiple data types, such as strings, integers, floats, and \n",
    "booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Name  Age  Gender\n",
    "John  25   Male\n",
    "Jane  30   Female\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the DataFrame has three columns (Name, Age, and Gender) and two rows (John and Jane). Each row contains different\n",
    "data types (strings, integers, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q5. What are some common functions you can use to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame? Can\n",
    "you give an example of when you might use one of these functions?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "Common functions for manipulating data in a Pandas DataFrame include: \n",
    "- head() - to view the first few rows of a DataFrame \n",
    "- tail() - to view the last few rows of a DataFrame \n",
    "- describe() - to generate descriptive statistics for numerical columns \n",
    "- info() - to get a summary of the DataFrame \n",
    "- drop() - to remove columns or rows from a DataFrame \n",
    "- sort_values() - to sort the values in a DataFrame by one or more columns \n",
    "- groupby() - to group data in a DataFrame by one or more columns \n",
    "- pivot_table() - to create a pivot table from a DataFrame \n",
    "- melt() - to reshape a DataFrame from wide to long format \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might use the groupby() function to group data in a DataFrame by a particular column, \n",
    "such as the year of a dataset. This would allow you to easily analyze data by year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q6. Which of the following is mutable in nature Series, DataFrame, Panel?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: DataFrame and Panel are mutable in nature.\n",
    "     Series is immutable in nature.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\"\"\"Q7. Create a DataFrame using multiple Series. Explain with an example.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: A DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure that can store data of different types (e.g., strings, integers, \n",
    "floats). It is similar to a spreadsheet or an SQL table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DataFrame can be created using multiple Series. A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object containing an array \n",
    "of data and an associated array of data labels, called its index.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have two Series, one containing the names of four people and the other containing their ages.\n",
    "We can create a DataFrame using these two Series as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create Series for names and ages\n",
    "names = pd.Series(['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo'])\n",
    "ages = pd.Series([25, 27, 28, 24])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create DataFrame using the two Series\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'Name': names, 'Age': ages})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print DataFrame\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will produce the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "#output\n",
    "#    Name  Age\n",
    "#0   John   25\n",
    "#1   Paul   27\n",
    "#2  George   28\n",
    "#3  Ringo   24"
